            <h2>How to Help</h2>

            <p>
                If you want to participate, we’d love it if you could do the following:

            </p>

            <ul>

                <li>Think about who you’re hoping will be protected (it doesn’t have to be the people we listed… whoever or whatever message you want is fine).  Alternatively, if you’re someone particularly vulnerable, you might want to write instead from the perspective of gratitude for what people are doing.  Just, think about why you’re staying home, and write a message for the people you’re staying home for.  If English isn’t your first language, other languages would be great… but please let Eric and Anthony know the English translation.  They’ll collect these along with your countries (but not your names, for privacy reasons).  Write the message clearly on a sheet of paper (an ideal message is five or six words long, and no more than about fifteen words), in large, thick writing (a marker is perfect). You can also be creative (add some art) with your sign if you wish. Look right at the camera, and you don’t have to smile but smiles are great.  Posing with family members and pets is also great, if you want… for example if there’s someone in your household that you love and want to keep safe.  Be sure to explain the project and get their permission, of course… and ideally you should be the person holding the sign.</li>
                <li>If you have more than one idea for a message, more than one picture would be great… that would give us a chance to choose (say, if people send very similar messages and we want variety).</li>
                <li>Please only send your image if you’re comfortable with it going on the internet, and being shared very widely.  Also, if you’re under 18, please check with a parent, and get their agreement as well.  We want to avoid everyone doing all this work and then having to take the video down, so we’re asking that people write a form that says “I, ___, am fine with my image being used for the breakwater video on the internet”, and if you and a parent could sign and date it, and snap a picture of that to send (in a separate image) that would be really great.  Nobody’s name or anything not in the photo will be shared, except a translation of your message, and your country.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>

                Send your photos to <strong>eric2003james@gmail.com</strong> or dm them to me <strong>@saskatoonboy</strong> along with the english translation and your country. Sadly we won't be able to include everyone's photos but we'll put them all up on this site. Also we're asking people to send their photos by 12pm CST on the 31st of March.
                
                <br><br>
                Post photos to social media using #breakwater... even if you aren't in the video, this is a way to show support.  Please try to pass this message along we really want to get as many people involved as possible!                
                
                <br><br>Thank you so much for being a part of this, and stay safe!

            </p>

            <h3>Can't think of what to write?</h3>

            <p> Look at all the <a href="examples.html">examples</a> of people who have already sent us photos!<br>
                
                Ask yourself. Why are you staying home? For who are you staying home?<br>

                If that doesn't give you an idea 
                
                imagine the front line medical workers, getting ready to face having the choice of who gets ventilators, getting ready to work without masks. Picture grand parents who fought for us in wars, or people who are sick from cancer that they just beat and thought they’d be okay but now they’re afraid the virus will get them. Picture those people, and know that they’re staying home to step between those people and the wave of virus headed their way. What do you want to say to those people who are scared and who want to know if the youth have their backs or not?</p>
