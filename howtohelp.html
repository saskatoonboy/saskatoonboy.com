            <p>
                If you want to participate, we’d love it if you could do the following:

            </p>

            <ul>

                <li>Think about who you’re hoping will be protected (it doesn’t have to be the people we listed… whoever or whatever message you want is fine).  Just, think about why you’re staying home, and write a message for the people you’re staying home for.  If English isn’t your first language, other languages would be great… but please let Eric and Anthony know the English translation.  They’ll collect these along with your countries (but not your names, for privacy reasons).  Write the message clearly on a sheet of paper (an ideal message is five or six words long, and no more than about fifteen words), in large, thick writing (a marker is perfect). You can also be creative (add some art) with your sign if you wish. Look right at the camera, and you don’t have to smile but smiles are great.  Posing with family members and pets is also great, if you want… for example if there’s someone in your household that you love and want to keep safe.  Be sure to explain the project and get their permission, of course… and ideally you should be the person holding the sign.</li>
                <li>If you have more than one idea for a message, more than one picture would be great… that would give us a chance to choose (say, if people send very similar messages and we want variety).</li>
                <li>Please only send your image if you’re comfortable with it going on the internet, and being shared very widely.  Also, please check with a parent, and get their agreement as well.  We want to avoid everyone doing all this work and then having to take the video down, so we’re asking that people write a form that says “I, ___, am fine with my image being used for the breakwater video on the internet”, and if you and a parent could sign and date it, and snap a picture of that to send (in a separate image) that would be really great.  Nobody’s name or anything not in the photo will be shared, except a translation of your message, and your country.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>

                Send your photos to <strong>eric2003james@gmail.com</strong> along with the english translation and your country. Please get your photos to us a soon as possible because we already have reporters asking us about the video.
                
                <br><br>
                Post photos to social media using #breakwater... even if you aren't in the video, this is a way to show support (or a way for people of any age to show support).  Please try to pass this message along we really want to get as many people involved as possible!                
                
                <br><br>Thank you so much for being a part of this, and stay safe!

            </p>
