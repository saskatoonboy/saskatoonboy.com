          <h2>Eric</h2>
          <p>Hi! My name is Eric and I’m one of your Canadian JCs!  I’m from Saskatoon which is the city that currently holds the record for the world’s biggest snowball fight. I have only been in CISV for 4 years, but I have loved every moment of it and am very active on my chapters Junior Board. CISV has been an awesome part of my life and I can’t wait to be your JC! Outside of CISV, I spend lots of time in the computer programming world and I have been working to become a lifeguard in the last few months. I can solve a Rubik's cube! I am super excited to be a JC and can’t wait to meet everyone!</p>

          <h2>Fer</h2>
          <p>Heyyyy! I’m Fernanda, the Costa Rican JC, you can call me Fer! I turned 16 about a month ago and I live in San José, Costa Rica and I’m currently a junior. I’m also missing the first month of my junior year for camp! Costa Rica is a really tiny country in Central America, many times confused with Puerto Rico. We have tons of beaches, and also a ton of volcanoes! My mom was part of CISV years before she had me and that’s why I got into it. I went to my village in 2014 in Aalborg, Denmark and the next year I took part in a national camp in Mexico! Now, what I’ve been waiting for since I’ve been 11, I’m a JC! I absolutely love sports, any one, soccer, basketball, volleyball, you name it! Besides sports I love spending my time drawing, really anything I see, along with listening to music, which you will see I do all the time. I play piano and violin but I mostly enjoy listening to all types of music, and occasionally dancing to it too. My favorite food is chicken nuggets and pizza (although I’m lactose intolerant and should absolutely not eat pizza). I’m so happy to meet everyone and spend an amazing month together!</p>

          <h2>Sebas</h2>
          <p>Heyyyoo! I'm Seba and I'm your Portuguese JC! I'm from Lisbon, the capital of Portugal. Lisbon currently is the biggest CISV chapter of the whole world! I have lived in Belgium for 7 years, and it was quite an experience! I like to play football, to play the piano, and to go to concerts! I have been in CISV since I was 11, when I went to a village in Denmark, last year I joined a Step Up in Italy, and I'm super excited to share this village with you!</p>
