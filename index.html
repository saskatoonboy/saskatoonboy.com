            <p>

                As a family, we’ve been stopping going to school and doing a lot of the measures that other countries have advised.  Even younger people, who’ve been told they won’t get seriously ill, are staying home to try to limit the spread.  We want to keep older people and people with other illnesses safe, and we want to help medical people have time to get the safety equipment they’ll need.  Our dad is older, and works in the hospital, so we’re really aware of how as he’s getting ready to protect people, the people staying home are doing their part to protect him, too.  We wanted to do something to bring peoples’ spirits up…. Especially younger people who are frustrated to be staying home, and older and vulnerable people and hospital workers, who are scared.  We wanted to connect people.

                <br><br>We thought it would be cool to make a video that is a collage of people under 20, all holding up signs of solidarity and care for older people, vulnerable people, and health care workers.  If you want to participate, <a href="howtohelp.html">Learn about how to help</a>
